DESCRIPTION:
GeoMeasure lets you measure distances from your current location in kilometers, miles, yards, and feet using GPS.


USES:
Measuring the length of:
- a Soccer field
- a Golf shot (ex. Long Drive Contest)
- a street
Or Measuring the distance between:
- two Cities
- two people's houses
- two Airports
Or even:
- Mark where you parked your car at a concert, amusement park, etc.
- Help you find your way back to your home port while on your boat.
- Mark where you buried some treasure!!


HOW TO USE IT:
The simplest method of entering a location is to use the "Save Here As..." menu item.
You can also use the Contacts to look up an address, or you can enter an address or named location. (it appears that the emulator's implementation of GeoCoding is not able to complete this task at this time).
The compass shows the direction you are moving, and the arrow shows the direction to the target.


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
- Ability to pick two locations from the database to measure between them instead of one location and your current location.


NOTES: 
"emulator -wipe-data" might be required if you get any "broadcast null" intent errors.
